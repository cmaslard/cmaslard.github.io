Hi, I am Corentin and this is my research website!

My research aims to understand how **plants** can better adapt to changes in water availability and rising temperatures throughout their growth cycle. To do this, I'm focus on the study of **root** structures and their interactions with **micro-organisms**. My broader aim is to contribute to the development of sustainable agroecosystems capable of withstanding future challenges such as **increasing temperatures** and **drought** event frequencies, while optimizing crop yields and soil health.

Given the complexity of the relationships between plants and micro-organisms, this research requires innovative and **integrative** strategies. I use plant phenotyping techniques alongside advanced data analysis tools, including deep learning and omics approaches such as high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics and ionomics. By merging computational methods with cutting-edge biological knowledge, I aim to push the boundaries of plant research and contribute to the creation of resilient agricultural systems.

I believe in **Open Science** and the importance of science communication.

I am currently a post-doctoral student at [INRAe](https://www.inrae.fr/en) (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment) in the [UMR Agroécologie](https://eng-umr-agroecologie.dijon.hub.inrae.fr/) in Dijon.
