This course was created by [me](https://cmaslard.xyz/me.html) under the supervision of [Thomas Badet](https://www.unine.ch/sciences/biographie/thomas-badet) for the third session of the [bioinformatics tools course](medias/bioinformatic_tools_mcom_analyse/plan_2025-2026_3BL2194.pdf){target="_blank"}(3BL2194). It provides an understanding of the basics of microbial community analysis, in particular the analysis of bacteria and fungi via amplicon sequencing using the 16S and ITS portions.
