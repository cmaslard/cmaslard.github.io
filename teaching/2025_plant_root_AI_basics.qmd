This course was created by [me](https://cmaslard.xyz/me.html) under the supervision of [Joop Vermeer](https://www.unine.ch/lbmc/2024/09/25/research-topic-2/). This course is designed to give participants a practical introduction to how artificial intelligence, especially machine learning and deep learning can be used to analyse plant root images and extract quantitative root traits.
